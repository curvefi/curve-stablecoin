# Llamalend Tests

If you think the folder layout is inconsistent, that's because it is!

We're in the progress of migrating tests from a semantic layout (controller, flashloan, lending, mpolicy, vault) to a more structured layout (unit, fork, integration, fuzzing, stateful, etc). Thank you for your patience.
